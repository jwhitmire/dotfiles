* Alcohol Information
** Behavioral cues for visibly intoxicated (in order)
*** lowered inhibitions
**** Signs
***** mood swings
***** over-confidence
***** boisterousness or extreme loudness
***** risk-taking or out-of-character displays
**** Can be misleading, could be natural personality
**** Keep a close eye, but look for other signs before taking action.
*** impaired judgment
**** Signs - doing things they would not normally do, or inappropriate behavior
***** foul language
***** annoying other people
**** Again, could be normal personality, but should raise more concern.  Should gather more info before serving any more alcohol to that guest.
*** slowed reactions
**** signs
***** glassy, unfocused eyes
***** slurred speech
***** very slow speech or movement
***** forgetfulness of what they are talking about
**** These are almost never part of normal behavior.  If you see this, you are likely done serving them alcohol.
*** loss of coordination
**** Signs
***** stumbling or swaying
***** drops belongings
***** having trouble sitting on stool or chair
***** falling asleep at the bar
**** Needs immediate help.  Lend assistance.
*** Tolerance can hide behavioral cues, but that doesn't imply their BAC is below the legal limit.
** Intoxication rate factors
*** Physical size - smaller people are more quickly affected by alcohol than larger people
**** body fat is the exception to the rule.  Body fat does not absorb alcohol, so only lean muscle mass applies to the size factor.
*** Gender - women tend to be affected more quickly than men.  They typically are smaller than men with a higher pct of body fat which results in being more sensitive to alcohol
*** Rate of consumption - A person drinking fast is affected quicker than a person drinking slowly.
*** Strength of drink: the higher the percentage of pure alcohol, the quicker you will be affected.  Type doesn't matter, strength does.
**** Each of the following contains about 1/2 oz of pure alcohol:
***** 1 oz of 100-proof liquor
***** 12 oz of beer
***** 5 oz of wine
**** Mixers can affect the absorption rate of alcohol.  Absorption from fastest to slowest:
***** straight shot of liquor
***** carbonated mixer
***** water mixer
***** juice mixer
*** Food - Eating food before/while drinking significantly slows down intoxication.
**** Eating AFTER drinking does NOT slow down absorption of alcohol already consumed
*** Drug use - mixing alcohol with legal or illegal drugs can speed up its effects and have an unpredictable outcome.
** Relating behavior and intoxication factors to BAC
*** The more behavioral cues you see, the higher the likelihood of a high BAC
*** Intoxication factors can help enlighten BAC regardless of cues
*** BAC
**** Alcohol absorbed quickly when not slowed down by food or mixers
**** Alcohol processed at a fairly steady rate, about 3/4 oz/hour of pure alcohol
**** Only time lowers BAC.  Not coffee, cold showers, exercise, etc.
**** 1 hour/drink is the general guideline for your body to process alcohol.
**** BAC will be affected differently every time you drink, and is obscured by tolerance.
* Intervention Information
** safe-service guidelines
*** always check id
**** card anyone that looks under 30
**** you are responsible, even if you think somebody else may have already carded them
*** match your response to the behavioral cues.
*** make as many reasonable efforts as you can.
**** make a serious effort to ensure the safety of your guests
*** do not back down
**** your first priority is excellent customer service, but safety first
**** remind yourself
***** you have the guest's well being in mind
***** people are depending on you to do the right thing
***** serving alcohol to a guest that cannot legally consume it is worse than illegally serving a guest by accident
***** others are watching, it's important to set an example of doing the right thing
***** if you back down this time, it's harder to do it the next time.
*** Call for assistance when necessary
*** If in doubt, do not serve
** Guidelines to avoid escalation
*** communicate clearly, use simple statements and be direct, but remain polite and professional
*** Use I statements - move the focus off the guest and onto you instead.  Shifts the conversation from negative to positive.
**** But not "I think you've had too much...", remain direct.
*** Do not judge or threaten guests
*** Provide a reason for your actions
*** Sometimes indirect is better
**** if the guest is intimidating or violent, buy some time with an indirect strategy
**** get the ID approved by the manager
**** enlist the help of the guest's friend
**** convince them to get something without alcohol
** Intervention model
*** assess the guest to determine if they can legally consume alcohol
**** observe guest, noting behavioral cues and intoxication rate factors
**** engage in conversation
**** note how other guests respond to and interact with guest
**** gather as much information about this guest as possible
*** decide whether you are going to serve them (you must answer NO to all of these)
**** do you need to check their id?
**** are they buying alcohol for someone else who is underage?
**** are they showing signs of intoxication?
**** do you have any doubts about serving them alcohol?
*** implement your decision using the safe-service and customer service guidelines
